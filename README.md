Restaurant Menu & Franchise System

This project is a Python-based restaurant menu system that I built as part of the Classes section in my Python 3 course on Codecademy. 
It demonstrates the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, specifically focusing on class creation, instance methods, and object relationships.

About This Project
This program models a restaurant's menu system using Python classes, allowing:
Menu creation** with items, prices, and availability times
Franchise locations that use these menu
Bill calculation based on ordered items
Checking available menus** at a given time
